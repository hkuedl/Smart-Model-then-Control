```90_full_Model_ind_Y_lin.pt```: the trained latent model as a warm start.

```90_full_Model_joint_lin.pt```: the final and determined latent model of the proposed method in 'Lat_MB'.

```90_whole_Lin.pt```: the trained model with original variables, served as the model in 'Ori_MB'.

```90_whole_NN.pt```: the assumed ground-truth model to represent the real thermal dynamics.

```HZ_AE_P.npy```: the initial solutions of decision variables for the ground-truth optimization.
